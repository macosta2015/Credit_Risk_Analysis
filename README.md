# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Challenge 17 


### Overview of the analysis:
We are going to use different types of machine learning models. We are going to use three different type of machine learning algorithms to see which one is better to predict risk. 

1. Oversampling RandomOverSamplet
2. SMOTE
3. Undersampling ClusterCentroids

It is important to note that we have been learning that we have supervised and unsupervised learning. 

### Important General information
#### Libraries: imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries

### With supervised learning we are able to get a sample data to keep and compare it againts the model. We are going to use the model to check the predictions and aftwerwards check it with our data sample.

### Please note that before starting the work, we first need to read a CSV.file and then check what information is relevant. What data is actually valuable for the model. As well, plenty of times, we need to transform the data type that we have and even convert it into a numerical form. This is so that the mode is able to read the information. 


### Results: 


### Summary:
